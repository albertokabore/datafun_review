The California BRFSS is an annual cross-sectional health-related telephone survey that collects data about California residents regarding their health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services.  The BRFSS is conducted by Public Health Survey Research Program of California State University, Sacramento under contract from CDPH. This prevalence rate does not include pre-diabetes, or gestational diabetes. This is based on the question: \"Has a doctor, or nurse or other health professional ever told you that you have diabetes?\" The sample size for 2014 was 8,832. NOTE: Denominator data and weighting was taken from the California Department of Finance, not U.S. Census. Values may therefore differ from what has been published in the national BRFSS data tables by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or other federal agencies.",
